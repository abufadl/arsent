# About this app
Arabic Sentiment Analysis - App powered by [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)  
The model behind this app was trained on positive and negative reviews (hotels, restaurants, ...) using the [Flair NLP](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/) library and by fine-tuning [bert-base-multilingual-cased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) from Huggingface. It was not fully trained (around 0.89 accuracy).    
The first time you run the app, it will download around 700 MB (not to your device, but to the app server). This may take a few seconds (up to 5).  
This app is hosted on Streamlit servers using a free plan with minimum resources. It is not production ready.
